Onset detection -> pitch detection
For chord detection -> how to do polyphony?

Should do my own processing algorithm.
1) Connect onset and pitch detection
2) Time onset detection at a believable rate
2) Implement a wage system: Check Amplitude Characteristics for different frequencies A(f,t) ->
    -> thresholds for different frequencies should be changed based on this.
